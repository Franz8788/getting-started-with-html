<h1>Introduction to coding</h1>

<h2>The internet in general</h2>
<p>The internet is the largest global computer network. How does it work? Basically, we need the following elements for it to run: <em>Servers</em>, the <em>internet</em>, the <em>HTTP protocol</em> (Hypertext transfer protocol), and a <em>browser</em> to read the files that are transferred.</p>

<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
<p><b>HTML</b> is the language used on the internet. The abbreviation stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> meaning that here is not only text, but also rules how the text is structured. <b>CSS</b>  (Cascading Style Sheets) concern the presentation of a document, which can be changed by changing the CSS.</p>

<h2>HTML elements</h2>
<p><b>HTML</b> elements consist of contents and <em>tags</em>. Tags are made up of tag names and <em>angled brackets</em> surrounding the tag names. Often the contents are wrapped by <em>opening tags</em> and <em>closing tags</em>. But there are also <em>void tags</em> such as &ltbr&gt (Break). &ltbr&gt stands alone and needs no closing tag later in the text. Other examples for tags are: &ltb&gt (bold, opening tag), &lt/b&gt (bold, closing tag), &ltem&gt and &lt/em&gt for italicized parts, &ltp&gt and &lt/p&gt for opening and closing a paragraph.</p>

<h2>Inline and block elements</h2>
<p>In general, <b>inline elements</b> are flowing with the text of the document (for example: &ltimg&gt), <b>block elements</b> have an invisible box around them (for example: &ltp&gt and &lt /p&gt). But we were assured that for beginners it is not necessary to understand the differences in every detail.</p>

<h2>Links and images</h2>
<p><b>Links</b> are inline elements. Same goes for <b>images</b>. An example for an inactive <em>link</em> is (included here for clarification): &lta href=”www.udacity.com”&gtinactive content&lt/a&gt. An example for an active <em>link</em> is: <a href=”www.udacity.com>active content</a>. href represents an attribute. In the case of images the attribute is not href, but src.</p>
<p><em>Attention</em>: Do not mix up src and href.</p>

<h2>Most important points</h2>
<h3>What is a webpage?</h3>
<p>A text document which was written in <em>HTML</em>.</p>
<h3>How does coding work?</h3>
<p>Programmers write text in a language computers can understand.</p>
<h3>Why are computers “stupid”?</h3>
<p>Computers take things literally. Small mistakes can have big consequences.</p>
<h3>Do programmers have to remember everything?</h3>
<p>There are <em>too many details</em> to keep in your head. That is why it is okay to look things up.</p>
<h3>How does the basic HTML vocabulary look like?</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Tags</b>: Tags have<em> angled brackets</em>.</li>
<li><b>Elements</b>: All within <em>opening</em> and <em>closing</em> tag plus the tags themselves. </li>
<li><b>Attributes</b>: Are properties of <em>HTML elements</em>. For example to set<br> the href attribute of an anchor tag to www.udacity.com<br> (&lt a href=”www.udacity.com”&gtcontent&lt/a&gt, included again for clarification)</li>
</ol>
